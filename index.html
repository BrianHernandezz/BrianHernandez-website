        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business📚</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Brian Hernandez and I’m currently attending the University of California, Riverside with a plan to earn a business degree in accounting. I graduated from East Valley Senior High School in the year 2019, making me a sophomore here at UCR. I always saw myself wanting to pursue a career in business, but never understood the steps needed to accomplish such a goal. During the summer prior to enrolling at UCR, I took a tour of the campus itself to see if I truly wanted to declare this specific school. One of the major contributing factors that made me want to attend UCR was the fact that its business program stood out from all the other universities in California. Although I had plenty of other schools to choose from, this school stood out to me on a professional level because of how well known it was for it’s business program. Ever since I attended that one campus tour, I knew UCR was going to be one of my top choices.<br><br>

        Aside from choosing to attend UCR because of how much more it’d improve my chances of working in the business field, I knew it would also bring me more work experience. I’ve currently only gained formal work experience from a voluntary internship I took part in at my local High School. I was able to get insight on how to basically manage a school during its summer sessions. While taking part in this summer internship I gained a set of crucial work skills, such as independent skills, organization skills, time management skills, and teaching skills. Many of these skills will contribute to my ability to work in a business field, given some are critical to the building blocks of running a business.<br><br>

        Aside from taking part in an internship, I will soon be working at a retail store to mainly broaden my social skills. One of the main reasons I chose to work at a retail store was to get out of my comfort zone, all while getting a glimpse of how I might have to interact with individuals while running a business. Although I currently may not have as much work experience as I’d want, I like to consider myself well with numbers. Ever since I could remember, I’ve always gravitated towards wanting to solve a solution with any given number because of how well it would play into conquering some of the calculus courses required to earn a business degree.
